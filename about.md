title: About Me
---
As someone who always curious about numbers and news, I love to translate data into meaningful and valuable insights. My goal is to improve the results, make the right decision and save costs.

To be honest, I am also lazy in some points, so that I always try to find the best way to save time on work which help me to solve the problem faster. 
I am interested in both exploratory analysis and diagnostic analysis so that machine learning, supervised and unsupervised algorithms as well as data visualization are what I would learn and use in my work.

I use SQL, R, Python, PowerBI and Tableau for my projects

    desc: In the pandemic time, as a student, I spent so much time in watching movies/ TVs from Netflix. Because of that, I have an idea that what if I could analyze the data from Netflix to see how Netflix is doing. 
    I wasnt sure that I could find the dataset, but I was lucky that this is a famous dataset in Kaggle. In that way, I could try my best to practice what I have learned with this.
